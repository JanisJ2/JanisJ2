- Implemented and tuned **DDQN and DDPG** agents for mean-reverting assets and short-term alpha signals
- Designed evaluation pipelines including **policy heatmaps, loss curves, and simulation-based analysis**
- Focused on interpreting agent behavior in **stochastic, partially observable environments**

---

### 🔹 Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Play (Hanabi)
- Research project on **multi-agent reinforcement learning** for the cooperative card game Hanabi
- Replicated and evaluated **MAPPO** in the Hanabi Learning Environment
- Analyzed coordination, communication challenges, and training stability
- Collaborated in a small team to design code structure and maintain technical documentation

---

### 🔹 Scriptorium: Code Execution & Blogging Platform
- Built a full-stack platform for **code execution, sharing, and technical blogging**
- Worked across frontend (**React, Tailwind CSS**), backend (**Next.js, Prisma**), and infrastructure (**Docker, Vercel**)
- Designed APIs and database schemas supporting voting, replies, and accessibility features
- Deployed a containerized runtime to support **multi-language code execution**
